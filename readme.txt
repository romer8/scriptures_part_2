PROJECT 2

Project 2 was a great experience, and it was a good practice for making the website responsive and learning some javascript animations. The responsiveness of the web page was
done with media queries in the css file defining three different resolution. In addition, doing the animations was a great practice to animate content that is related with
callbacks. This is because both the transition and the fade animation are called twice one before the callback and another the callback was called. I enjoyed making the two animations
because I had to think really hard how to connect the animation that was going in with the one that was going out. On summary, project 2 was a helpful experience because it
helped me to learn responsive design and aniamtions.

In addition,I showed the web page to my friend Alan Garcia, and to my girlfriend Mariana Gutierrez. Both of them told me that the app looks good, and that the functionality of the
animation was good, but it needed to be faster, so I reduce the time of the animation in and out.
